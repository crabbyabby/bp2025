    <h2>
       Girls in CS is an <strong>after-school</strong> program aimed at providing a space for young girls 
        to <strong>explore computer science </strong>. Over the three weeks the girls will learn <strong>HTML and CSS</strong> 
         and at the end they will create their own personalize websites. Through this initiative, we aim to foster diversity in STEM
          by encouraging girls to develop technical skills and confidence in a supportive environment.

        ""Before joining Girls in CompSci, I had never written a single line of code.
        Now, I’ve built my own website and feel so much more confident in tech. This program showed me that
        computer science is for everyone!" <br>– Hareem, 8th Grade"

        "The Girls in CompSci program has been an incredible addition to our school.
         It empowers students who might not have otherwise explored computer science, and the skills 
         they gain go beyond coding—they’re learning problem-solving, teamwork, and creativity." <br>– Mr. LaBaire, STEM Teacher
